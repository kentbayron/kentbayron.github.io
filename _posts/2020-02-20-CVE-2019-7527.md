# Summary:

It was long ago when I found this bug which was recognized last year and eventually the reason why I got CVE. It's a quiet tuesday morning, during my first day being an OJT. My mentor told me that my first task is to install **Frappe/ERPNext**. I just finished installing the framework and waiting for my next task, I got bored and just lurking around until I stumbled on login page. It was my pioneering days of learning bug bounty and the first thing I learned is **XSS** so I wondered, what if I will inject a script tag on login fields will there be a pop up?,so I quickly fired a basic **XSS** script tag and luckily I got a pop up. I also determined that all fields are vulnerable to xss.

# Proof of Concept
1. Install **Frappe** on your local machine.
2. Run it, usually it runs on [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000)
3. Insert basic xss script to login fields. 
4. Enter and the XSS will pop up. 
5. All fields are vulnerable to XSS.
